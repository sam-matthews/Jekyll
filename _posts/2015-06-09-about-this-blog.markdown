Welcome! This blog is, well all about me, ionformation about how I do things, how I make things, what projects I'm currently working on, my tech setup and many other bits which are related to how things are done.

The intention ? Communicate everything I have done. If someone wants to use my current projects, then they can use the ideas which I'm doing. No problem :(

# Projects

## Jekyll

The number one project I'm working on at the moment is this blogging site. Currently this site is using [Jeckyll](http://jekyllrb.com). There is a reasonable amout of automation which needs to happen, but I'll work through these with posts on the various subjects. I'll also discuss how my environment has been setup including hosting details.

## Treehouse

[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) is a training company specilising in various, mainly web based development languages (including wordpress), although there is some good content around Mobile development languages. I'd hope sometime in the future I'll be using some of these. 

Occassionally I'll be off learning some new technology, so there may be times when I'm not posting too much, so don't panic !
