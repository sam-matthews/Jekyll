Having starting to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - to be honest this static blogging engine is looking pretty good. I like this tool because:

1. Jekyll is easily configurable.
2. Jekyll is a static blogging engine which means it should be lightening fast.
3. posts to Jekyll can easily be updated by using some basic unix commands such as ssh to migrate the posts to your website.
4. Other website changes are automatically pushed as well.
5. There is no database, so everything is a bunch of text files and therefore the site can easily be held in GIT or some other version control tool.

There are a few missing parts, an easy way of transforming drafts into posts and migrating the posts and other changes into the real website.
