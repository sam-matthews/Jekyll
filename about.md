This site is all about how I do things with regard to the different projects I'm working on. I intend this site to be very technical and I'll try to show this information in an interesting manner. Ideally I'd like to use a variety of different media. Intially text, then photos, then video (Screencasts). This is a work in progress so over time you will be able to see how my projects develop.

I would also like this site be a how-to and reference point for others who would like to do similar projetcs as mine, or maybe use a part of one of my projects. I'm learning as well so please join me in my Journey.
